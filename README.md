Chaos-based application of a novel no-equilibrium chaotic system with coexisting attractors


Novel designs for chaotic systems and their engineering applications have garnered significant critical interest. This is a code about a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-017-3558-2) which introduces a new three-dimensional chaotic system and its application.
This chaotic system is intriguing due to the absence of equilibrium sites and the coexistence of limit cycle and torus. Using phase pictures, bifurcation diagrams, continuation, and Lyapunov exponents, the fundamental dynamics of the non-equilibrium system have been calculated. The experimental findings of the electronic circuit implementing the no equilibrium system have demonstrated the viability of the system. We have built a random bit generator for use in practical signal encryption by utilizing the system's lack of equilibrium and its inherent chaos. The utility of the random bit generator is illustrated by numerical results.
